        <h1>Swagstakes — Terms of Service</h1>
        <h2>Frosty Fortune · Last Updated: November 21, 2025</h2>

        <p class="tos-text">
            Thank you for using Swagstakes! These Terms of Service (the “Terms”) govern your access to and use of Swagstakes and the Frosty Fortune interactive experience (collectively, the “Service”). By using the Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms. We reserve the right to update or modify these Terms at any time; changes will be reflected by the "Last Updated" date above.
        </p>

        <h3>1. Information Collected</h3>
        <p class="tos-text">
            When you interact with the Service, we collect limited data for operation and anti-abuse purposes:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Unique Device Identifier (UDI)</strong> — a randomly generated identifier used to enforce one-play-per-device limits. This identifier is stored and used only within our system and does not contain data that can identify your device outside our platform.</li>
            <li><strong>Name</strong> — first name and last initial. Required to access the Service and retained for usage tracking and verification. Names are stored encrypted (AES-256) and are not shared outside our organization except when required by law.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="tos-text">
            We retain collected information as necessary to operate the Service, investigate disputes, and comply with legal obligations. See our Privacy Policy for full details.
        </p>

        <h3>2. Eligibility</h3>
        <p class="tos-text">
            To use the Service you must be at least <strong>13 years old</strong>. By participating you represent that you meet this age requirement. No purchase is necessary to play.
        </p>

        <h3>3. Usage Limits</h3>
        <p class="tos-text">
            Only one play per device is allowed. We store a Unique Device Identifier (UDI) to enforce this rule. Any attempt to bypass these limits (including use of multiple accounts, emulators, or manipulation of identifiers) may result in disqualification and suspension.
        </p>

        <h3>4. Results</h3>
        <p class="tos-text">
            All results are final once displayed. Names and UDIs may be retained for verification and auditing. We are not obligated to correct or reverse results that have already been revealed, including those affected by user error, connectivity issues, or device-level interruptions.
        </p>

        <h3>5. Prizes</h3>
        <p class="tos-text">
            Prizes are awarded at the sole discretion of the organizer. No prize is guaranteed. We reserve the right to verify eligibility and to refuse or revoke prizes if we determine there has been fraud, a rules violation, or a technical error.
        </p>
        <p class="tos-text">
            <strong>System errors:</strong> Any prizes awarded as a result of a system glitch, bug, exploit, or unauthorized manipulation will not be honored.
        </p>

        <h3>6. Game Mechanics</h3>
        <p class="tos-text">
            Frosty Fortune is a probability-based matching game. The Service uses randomized probability distributions to determine outcomes. Visual effects such as "magic ink" may be used to reveal matches. By participating you acknowledge the inherent randomness of the game and accept that outcomes are produced by the system's programmed probabilities before you reveal your matches.
        </p>

        <h3>7. Modification & Termination</h3>
        <p class="tos-text">
            We may suspend, modify, or discontinue the Service (or any feature, prize, or mechanic) at any time without prior notice. We may also suspend or terminate accounts or access for violations of these Terms or suspected abuse.
        </p>

        <h3>8. Acceptance of Terms</h3>
        <p class="tos-text">
            By engaging with Frosty Fortune or any component of Swagstakes you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agreed to these Terms. If you do not agree to these Terms, you must not use the Service.
